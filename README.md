# LinguaForest
LinguaForest is a research-driven design exploration that questions the assumption that language learning is a linear, easily measurable, and purely individual process. Grounded in the context of English Language Teaching (ELT), the project explores alternative ways of representing learning experiences through pedagogical metaphors, visual narratives, and reflective forms of learning data, rather than percentages, scores, or rankings. LinguaForest is not a finished application or product; it is a living conceptual framework that investigates how learning data in language education can be translated into more human-centered, non-judgmental, and pedagogically meaningful forms of feedback for both learners and teachers.
Most digital tools used in language education describe learning through simplified indicators such as levels, scores, completion rates, or progress bars. While these metrics are convenient to measure and compare, they often fail to reflect how language learning actually unfolds: unevenly, socially, emotionally, and over time. In ELT contexts in particular, learning is rarely linear; progress in one skill can coexist with stagnation or regression in another, and meaningful development is often visible only through patterns, reflection, and interaction rather than immediate results. As a consequence, both learners and teachers are frequently left with data that measures performance but does not support understanding, sense-making, or pedagogical reflection. LinguaForest emerges from this gap between what is easy to measure and what is educationally meaningful.
